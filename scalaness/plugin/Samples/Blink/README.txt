Blink README.txt
================

This folder contains a staged Blink sample. This sample generates a program that runs on a
single node and blinks an LED a fixed number of times. The Scalaness program computes the blink
period (in ms), the blink count, and an optimized data type for representing the count. To make
the sample more interesting, two Mininess modules are specialized and composed. Thus this
sample illustrates

1. Module specialization over both types and terms.
2. Module composition.

In addition this sample demonstrates how Scalaness generated code can interact with existing
(non-staged) libraries.
