=========

+ In scala/tools/nsc/Global.scala, in the method compileUnitsInternal (around line 1506). Here
  the compiler appears to execute the phases in order. I think you can execute code between the
  phases by putting it right after the invocation of globalPhase.run.

+ In scala/tools/nsc/plugins/Plugins.scala, around line 120, is a place where plugins are
  loaded. I hacked in an explicit call to addToPhasesSet to load the plugin for the Scalaness
  post-parser. This is really hacky and I'm not sure if this is a good way to go about it, but
  basically the post-parser is treated like a plugin phase that happens to have its code built
  into the compiler.
