\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

This dissertation would not have been possible without the assistance and guidance of many
people. I would especially like to thank my adviser Christian Skalka for many years of valuable
feedback. I would also like to thank my collaborators Sean Wang, Scott Smith, and especially
Simone Willet and Michael Watson for their invaluable assistance in making the work I describe
here a reality. Finally I'd like to thank the faculty and staff of the University of Vermont
Computer Science department for creating an environment that allowed me to flourish.
