% This is the main file to be complied by LaTex This is the dissertation which should meet the
% formatting requirements for the Graduate College at the University of Vermont
%
% By Yan Zhang, for 2008 Summer
%
% It includes elements developed
% by Yan Zhang at UVM (dedication page, show coadvisors' names), and
% by Like Gao at UVM, and
% by David Van Horn at UVM (most of cover pages}, and
% by John Carpenter at UIUC (most of skeleton stuff), and
% by John Shumway <john_shumway@nrel.gov> (most of the LaTeX stuff), and
% by John Pitney <john@pitney.org> (most of the PDF creation stuff).

% We use the standard 'report' document class from LaTeX 2e
\documentclass[11pt]{report}

% uvmdis.sty makes some adjustments to the report class to meet formatting requirements
\usepackage{uvmdis}

% chicago is the required citation style by UVM.
\usepackage{chicago}

% Various other supporting packages.
\input{packages}

% Various custom macros.

% I like \oneandhalfspace. \doublespace is the other choice.
