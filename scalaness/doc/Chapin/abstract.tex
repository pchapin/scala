\begin{abstract}
  Building programs for constrained embedded devices is challenging. Staged programming can help
  bridge the abstraction gap between high level algorithms and device level programs by allowing
  a first stage program to specialize device level code. Here I describe \textit{Scalaness} a
  two stage programming system for wireless sensor networks where type errors in all possible
  second stage programs are detected during the compilation of the first stage program. The
  implementation is intended to be both practical and grounded in a solid theoretical
  foundation. The system is then be used to implement a non-trivial access control system for
  sensor networks. The performance of the generated system is compared to that of a non-staged
  solution.
