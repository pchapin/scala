\begin{abstract}
  Building programs for constrained embedded devices is challenging. Staged programming can help
  bridge the abstraction gap between high level algorithms and device level programs by allowing
  a first stage program to specialize device level code. This proposed work entails implementing
  a two stage programming system for wireless sensor network nodes where type errors in all
  possible second stage programs are detected during the compilation of the first stage program.
  The implementation is intended to be both practical and grounded in a solid theoretical
  foundation. The system will then be used to implement a non-trivial access control system for
  sensor networks. The performance of the generated system will be compared to that of a
  non-staged solution.
