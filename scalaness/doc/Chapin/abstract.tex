  A wireless sensor network is an ad-hoc network of highly resource constrained embedded devices
  that communicate with each other over short hop radio links. Security in such systems has
  mostly been about keeping network data confidential from outsiders or ensuring the integrity
  of network data. However, as sensor networks from different administrative domains
  increasingly come into contact a need arises for a sensor network to allow partial access to
  its resources from adjoining networks. In this dissertation I explore two approaches to
  providing distributed trust management facilities to sensor networks. The first is a direct
  approach using a secure remote procedure call mechanism called \textit{SpartanRPC}. The second
  is a staged approach using a two stage programming system called \textit{Scalaness/nesT}. In
  addition to describing these two approaches I also present the results of evaluating them in
  both test environments and with a realistic application. Both approaches are feasible but the
  staged approach is far more flexible and, depending on application requirements, probably more
  efficient.
