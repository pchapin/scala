  Many embedded systems, such as wireless sensor networks, make use of highly resource
  constrained devices. Security goals for such systems tend to focus on keeping data
  confidential from outsiders or ensuring data integrity during communication. However as
  embedded systems from different administrative domains increasingly come into contact, for
  example via short hop radio links, a need arises for one system to allow partial access to its
  resources from adjoining systems. This dissertation explores two approaches for providing
  distributed trust management facilities to resource constrained embedded systems, in
  particular wireless sensor networks. The first is a direct approach using a secure remote
  procedure call mechanism called \textit{SpartanRPC}. The second is a staged approach using a
  two stage programming system called \textit{Scalaness/nesT}. In addition to describing these
  two approaches this dissertation also presents the results of evaluating them both in test
  environments and with a realistic application. Both approaches are feasible but the staged
  approach is far more flexible and, depending on application requirements, more efficient.
