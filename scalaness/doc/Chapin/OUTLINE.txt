Top level sections...

1. Introduction

   Provides an overview of the work along with its scope and motivation. My intention is to
   frame the work as two ways of solving the problem of application level authorization in
   sensor network applications: a direct approach using Sprocket, and a staged approach using
   Scalaness. Is this an appropriate place to discuss related work as well?

2. Trust Management

   Discuss the relevance of trust management for control authorization in distributed systems in
   general and the value of using it in sensor network applications. This section would contain
   material from the ACMCS paper.

3. Extended Example

   Describe the SnowCloud example in general terms and the intended security model to be applied
   to it. This is to set the stage for the security enabled versions presented later.

4. SpartanRPC and Sprocket

   This section contains material from the MASS and TISSEC papers. It describes the direct
   approach of solving the problem of the problem outlined in the introduction. I had thought to
   include both the description of the system and implementation specifics in separate
   subsections. Would that make this section too large?

5. NesT and Scalaness

   This section contains material from the GPCE paper. It describes the staged approach of
   solving the problem outlined in the introduction. For symmetry with the section above I had
   also thought to include both descripton and implementation specifics in separate subsections.
   Would that make this section too large?

6. Evaluation

   The performance of SpartanRCP/Sprocket and nesT/Scalaness are compared using primarly the
   extended SnowCloud example. However, other results as reported in our various papers are also
   include.

7. Conclusion

   Summarizes the results obtained and generalizes them (for example, Scalaness applies to
   potentially many embedded systems problems and not just authorization).
