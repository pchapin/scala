1. Introduction

   Provides an overview of the work along with its scope and motivation. My intention is to
   frame the work as two ways of solving the problem of application level authorization in
   sensor network applications: a direct approach using Sprocket, and a staged approach using
   Scalaness. The SnowCloud example is also presented in general terms.

   This chapter also contains a related work section for general work. Each technical chapter
   contains a subsection for related work related to that chapter.

2. Trust Management

   Discuss the relevance of trust management for authorization in distributed systems in general
   and the value of using it in sensor network applications. This section would contain material
   from the ACMCS paper.

3. SpartanRPC and Sprocket

   This section contains material from the MASS and TISSEC papers. It describes the direct
   approach of solving the problem of the problem outlined in the introduction. I had thought to
   include both the description of the system and implementation specifics in separate
   subsections.

4. NesT and Scalaness

   This section contains material from the GPCE paper. It describes the staged approach of
   solving the problem outlined in the introduction. It also includes a description of the type
   theory and formal semantics of nesT from the CC and LCTES submissions. For symmetry with the
   section above I had also thought to include both descripton and implementation specifics in
   separate subsections.

5. Evaluation

   The performance of SpartanRCP/Sprocket and nesT/Scalaness are compared using primarly the
   extended SnowCloud example. However, other results as reported in our various papers are also
   include.

6. Conclusion

   Summarizes the results obtained and generalizes them (for example, Scalaness applies to
   potentially many embedded systems problems and not just authorization).
