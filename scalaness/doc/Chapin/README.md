Dissertation of Peter C. Chapin
===============================

This folder contains the source of Peter Chapin's dissertation as prepared for the University of
Vermont in Fall 2013. The document is in LaTeX format and built with commands such as

    $ latex main
    $ bibtex main
    $ latex main
    $ latex main
    $ dvips main
    $ ps2pdf main.ps main.pdf

It uses the dissertation style prepared Yan Zhang (uvm-dissertation.sty). An alternative style
by David Van Horn and subsequently updated by Joshua Auerbach can be found here

However that style doesn't appear to work for me (I wonder if it is not well tested for standard
thesis. I get the feeling Joshua wrote a journal article thesis).
