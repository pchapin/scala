Build Procedure
===============

Building the document requires the following steps:

$ latex main
$ bibtex main
$ latex main
$ latex main
$ dvips main
$ ps2pdf main.ps main.pdf

The three invocations of LaTeX are needed to get all cross references right. It is necessary to
go through PS format because of the various EPS figures that are used. Also I believe the pic
figures use PostScript specials (not sure about that).


On Package Hyperref
===================

It would be nice to use package hyperref to get a navigable table of contents (the clickable
citations and cross-references are nice too). However, doing so makes the links unwrappable so
long citations stick out into the right margin. This arises because I'm using the dvips driver
which, apparently, can't handle wrapping links. Here is a quote from section 7 of the README.pdf
that comes with my hyperref:

<QUOTE>
Wrapped/broken link support
---------------------------
Only few drivers support automatically wrapped/broken links, e.g. pdftex, dvipdfm, hypertex.
Other drivers lack this feature, e.g. dvips, dvipsone.

Workarounds:

* For long section or caption titles in the table of contents or list of figures/tables option
  "linktocpage" can be used. Then the page number will be a link, and the overlong section title
  is not forced into an one line link with overvull \hbox warning.

* "\url"s are caught by package "breakurl".

* The option "breaklinks" is intended for internal use. But it can be used to force link
  wrapping, e.g. when printing a document. However, when such a document is converted to PDF and
  viewed with a PDF viewer, the active link area will be misplaced.
</QUOTE>

I attempted to use dvipdfm instead of dvips but that generated a large number of warnings and
produced an invalid document. I think dvipdfm can't deal with the EPS figures, etc, that I'm
using. It would be necessary to redraw some (all?) of my figures to switch to it.

The discussion here:

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/823/remove-ugly-borders-around-clickable-cross-references-and-hyperlinks

talks about how to remove the borders around clickable links. The "hidelinks" option mentioned
there does not appear to be supported by my version of hyperref (dated 2009, default version on
Ubuntu Linux 12.04). However adding this

\hypersetup{
  colorlinks=false,
  pdfborder={0 0 0},
}

does, indeed, remove the border. It doesn't change the way they are formatted, however; they
still stick out into the right margin.

I also tried the breaklinks option like this

\usepackage[breaklinks=true]{hyperref}

This worked in the sense that the links wrapped but, as mentioned in the README quote above, the
placement of the clickable area on the next line is wrong and looks terrible.

However, by combining these approaches (using breaklinks and then turning off the link border) I
get a document that has navigable bookmarks, proper formatting, and no ugly links. The links in
the document are still there and the ones that don't wrap are even in the right place, you just
can't see the (misplaced) borders. This seems like a good compromise.

Right now my conclusion is that hyperref can't be used and to fix this I would have to redraw
some, possibly all, of my figures in a form acceptable to a PDF driver.
