% I want to typeset newly introduced terms in a special way.
\newcommand{\newterm}[1]{\emph{#1}}

\newcommand{\inlinecode}[1]{\texttt{#1}}

\newcommand{\filename}[1]{\texttt{#1}}

% The \note macro is useful for creating easy to see notes.
\long\def\note#1{\marginpar{NT}{\small \ \ $\langle\langle\langle$\
{#1}\
    $\rangle\rangle\rangle$\ \ }} 

% I really should put this in a package file! Note how I set up some parameters before opening
% the listing. This used to be necessary when I was using verbatim environments. Is it still
% necessary with the listings package? Are those other settings just being overridden?
