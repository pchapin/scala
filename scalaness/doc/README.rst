Scalaness Documentation
=======================

This folder contains the user and design documentation of Scalaness. The main documentation is
written in DocBook format and requires a DocBook tool chain to convert into PDF, HTML, or
similar. DocBook files are plain text, however, and can be read using a simple text editor.

The folders that contain papers do not necessarily contain the *exact* version of the paper that
was submitted. In particular the version here may have a more correct or complete bibliography,
fixed typos, and cleaner, more consistent formatting. However the intention is for the content
of the documents to be as submitted. In particular older papers are not updated to reflect later
changes in the system (although they may be updated to fix flagrant errors).

The contents of the subfolders are as follows:

Chapin
    This folder contains the dissertation of Peter Chapin.

lib
    This folder contains various LaTeX style files and associated documentation. These files are
    for reference. The intention is for this folder to contain the most up-to-date and "correct"
    version of its contents. Any files with the same name in sibling folders are intended to be
    copies of the files here.
