\label{section-conclusion}

We have introduced Scalaness, a two stage programming system for
wireless sensor networks. Scalaness provides a powerful programming
environment for specializing and composing nesC modules in a type safe
way; any type correct Scalaness program will generate only type
correct residual programs.

Scalaness also provides a way to combine generated code with library
code. It is not necessary to generate an entire program with
Scalaness; instead only the parts of the final program that can
benefit from specialization need be processed. The system is intended
to support practical development of robust and efficient sensor
network applications, especially those applications that can benefit
from dynamic reconfiguration after deployment.
