==========

This directory contains various style and class files that have been used in the other Scalaness
documents. They are stored here for reference. At the moment each document that uses any of
these library components has a local copy of that component. It would probably make sense to
arrange for those documents to use a single copy here instead.

The Scala files in this folder are from the generic plugin template, specialized slightly for
Scalaness. Right now I don't believe I need the plugin phase types demonstrated by these files
but I'm keeping them here in case I change my mind later.
