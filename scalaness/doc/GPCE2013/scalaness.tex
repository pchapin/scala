\section{The Scalaness Language Distilled}
\label{section-scalaness}

Scalaness serves as the language for nesT module composition in the same manner as nesC
configurations serve to compose nesC modules, but Scalaness is a much more powerful metalanguage
since modules are treated as a new category of first class values in Scalaness. Instantiation,
composition (aka wiring), and imaging of modules are defined as operations on module values.
Because instantiation of modules with both types and values is allowed, types and values may
migrate from the Scalaness level to the nesT level after programmatic refinement, realizing a
disciplined form of code specialization.

%\snote{Scalaness formalized vs Scalaness implemented was not clear,
%  reworded this to bring out the difference.  May need some polishing,
%  take a pass at it.}  
Our goal in this Section is to describe the Scalaness syntax and semantics realized in our
implementation. Since Scala is too large to easily formalize, we define here a \emph{D}istilled
Scalaness, DScalaness, that extends a core typed object-oriented language to include syntax and
semantics for defining and composing DnesT modules. The particular object-oriented core calculus
we use is a combination of two Featherweight Java variants: Featherweight Generic Java (FGJ)
\cite{FJ} and Assignment Featherweight Java (AFJ) \cite{AFJ}.
% The generic class types of FGJ are needed to model type
% construction, and the mutation in AFJ is essential to consider since
% one of our main concerns is nesT code specialization. A formalized
% core calculus and type analysis for Scala exists
% \cite{Cremet:2006:CCS:2135978.2135980}, but our FGJ/AFJ route is
% simpler and the missed features are not relevant to the concerns here.
% should be obvious to readers, space saver cut - SS
%
% Furthermore, since Scala subsumes Java, definitions that include FGJ/AFJ features can be
% trivially ported to a Scala context.

% % %  subset of Scala
% % % expressed as an extension of Featherweight Java \cite{FJ}, a core
% % % calculus subsumed by Scala. A formalized core calculus and type
% % % analysis for Scala exists \cite{Cremet:2006:CCS:2135978.2135980}, but
% % % FJ is adequate and simpler.  We thus elide many features of Scala in
% % % the Scalaness formalization, but we adapt all Scala features unchanged
% % % in our Scalaness implementation.  Here we primarily focus on the
% % % module metaprogramming operations that we add.  The presentation here
% % % ``cleans up'' some implementation details, but is otherwise an
% % % accurate description of the module operation semantics and especially
% % % the module operation typing rules.

% Scalaness type checking is grounded in a previous foundational work, as discussed in
% \autoref{section-framedml}. The type checking algorithm presented here statically supports
% type safety at both programmatic levels, i.e.~if a Scalaness program type checks, then running
% it will not cause a type failure, \emph{and} residual nesT code will also be type-safe when
% run on its own.

\subsection{Syntax of DScalaness}

\scalanesssyntaxfig

The DScalaness language syntax is presented in \autoref{figure-scalanesssyntax}.
% % %  To represent an adequate core
% % % calculus of Scala, it subsumes two Featherweight Java variants:
% % % Featherweight Generic Java (FGJ) \cite{FJ} and Assignment Featherweight Java
% % % (AFJ) \cite{AFJ}. The generic class types of FGJ are needed to model
% % % type construction, and the mutation in AFJ is essential to consider
% % % since one of our main concerns is nesT code specialization; nesT
% % % programs are run in a separate process space, so specialization with
% % % stateful values, a likely common idiom in a Scala setting, presents a
% % % challenge.
We refer the reader to \cite{FJ,AFJ} for details on the FGJ and AFJ object oriented calculi,
which are represented in the languages of class definitions, constructors, methods, and the
first line of expression forms defined in \autoref{figure-scalanesssyntax}. DScalaness extends
these features with a typed variable declaration form $\jdef{x}{T}{e_1}{e_2}$ where the scope of
$\ttt{x}$ is $\tt{e_2}$, a dynamic type construction form $\jtlet{x}{T}{e_1}{e_2}$ with similar
scoping rules (although this is defined as syntactic sugar in \autoref{def-metatype}). For
programmer convenience a simple parameterized type abbreviation binder $\tt{abbrvt}$ is also
provided. We include DnesT modules $\jmodval$ in the DScalaness expression and value spaces:
instantiation is obtained via the form $\jinst{e_1}{\ttvec{e}_1; \ttvec{e}_2}$, where
$\ttvec{e}_\tt{1}$ are type parameters and $\ttvec{e}_\tt{2}$ are value parameters. Wiring of
modules is denoted $\jwire{\tt{e_1}}{\tt{e_2}}$. Imaging of modules, denoted $\jimage{\tt{e}}$,
ensures that $\tt{e}$ computes to a runnable DnesT module.

\subsection{Semantics of DScalaness}

The semantics of DScalaness is an extension of the semantics of AFJ and FGJ to incorporate DnesT
modules and operations. Computations assume a fixed class table $\CT$ allowing access to class
definitions via class names, which always decorate an object's type. A \emph{store} $\jstore$ is
a function from memory locations $\tt{p}$ to object representations. Objects are represented in
memory by lists of object references $\ttvec{l}$, which refer to the locations of the objects
stored in mutable field values. A reference $\tt{l}$ is a pair $\jref{\tt{p}}{N}$ where $\tt{p}$
is the memory location of an object representation and $\tt{N}$ is the nominal type of the
object, including its class name. Hence, given an object reference
$\jref{\tt{p}}{\jinst{C}{\ttvec{T}}}$, we can access and mutate its fields $\ttvec{l} =
\jstore(\tt{p})$, and access and use its methods via the definition $\CT(\tt{C})$.

Following AFJ, the semantics of DScalaness is defined as a \emph{labeled transition system},
where transitions are of the form $\tt{e} - \lc s = \jstore, s' = \jstore' \rc \rightarrow
\tt{e}' $. Intuitively, this denotes that given an initial store $\jstore$ and expression
$\tt{e}$, one step of evaluation results in a modified store $\jstore'$ and contractum
$\tt{e}'$. We write $\tt{e} \rightarrow \tt{e}'$ as an abbreviation when the store is not
altered.
% space saver - SS
%  When discussing the
% semantics of module operations in DScalaness we will use this
% abbreviated form, since they are purely functional.

% We refer the reader to \cite{XXX} for details on the semantics of AFJ
% and FGJ subsumed by DScalaness.
The primary novelty of DScalaness is the formal semantics of type and module construction. We
begin with type construction, which is provided to allow programmers to dynamically construct
module type instances. The appropriate behavior is obtained by treating dynamically constructed
types as extensions of a basic class of objects, and declarations of DnesT level types via a
\tt{typedef} construct as syntactic sugar for ordinary object construction. We define a
\tt{LiftableType} class as the supertype of all types of objects that can be used to instantiate
a module, and dynamically constructed types are defined as instances of a generic \tt{MetaType}
class.
\begin{definition}
\label{def-metatype}
Any DScalaness class table $\CT$ comprises the following definitions:
$$
\hspace{-4pt}
\begin{array}{l}
\CT(\tt{LiftableType}) = \\
\ \ \gclass{\tt{LiftableType}}{}{Object}{\ldots}\\
\CT(\tt{MetaType}) = \\
\ \ \gclass{\tt{MetaType}}{\tt{X <: LiftableType}}{Object}{ \ldots }
\end{array}
$$
And we take as given the following syntactic sugar:
$$
\jtlet{x}{T}{e_1}{e_2}\ \defeq\ \jdef{x}{\jinst{MetaType}{T}}{e_1}{e_2}
$$
Class type $\tt{MetaType}$ is generalized on a single type variable. For brevity of notation, we
define:
$$
\jinst{\tt{MetaType}}{\ttvec{T}}\quad \defeq \quad \overline{\jinst{MetaType}{T}}
$$
\end{definition}
A crucial fact of DScalaness type construction is that any dynamically constructed type cannot
be treated as a type at the DScalaness level. This is a more restrictive mechanism than
envisioned in our foundational model \cite{FramedML}, however it allows us to define DScalaness
as a straightforward extension to Scala, especially in terms of type checking.

Module instantiation, shown in \autoref{figure-jmodsemantics}, is the only point where
specialization of DnesT modules is allowed.
% , since non-local variables are disallowed in module
% definitions
Since DScalaness and DnesT are two different language spaces, some sort of transformation must
occur when values migrate from DScalaness to DnesT via module instantiation. This \emph{lifting}
transformation involves both data mapping and serialization since the process spaces also
differ. We aim to be flexible and allow the user to specify how values are lifted and how types
are transformed. We only require that lifting and type transformation are coherent, in the sense
that the lifting of an object should be typeable at the object's type transformation. We
formalize this in the following definition.% Note that lifting is defined on references,
% since this is how objects are referred to at run-time and we never
% want to allow lifting of modules.
\begin{definition}
\label{def-lifting}
We assume given a relation $\ser{\jstore}$ which transforms a DScalaness reference $\tt{l}$ into
DnesT declarations $\vect{d}$ and expression $e$. We also assume given a DScalaness-to-DnesT
transformation of types $\codt{\cdot}$. To preserve type safety, we require in all cases that
$\jref{p}{N} \ser{\jstore} \vect{d}, e$ implies both of the following for some type environment
$G$:
$$
\varnothing, \varnothing \vdash \vect{d} : \tenv \qquad \text{ and} \qquad
 \tenv, \varnothing \vdash e : \codt{\tt{N}} 
$$
\end{definition}
The full definition of serialization and an example are given and discussed below in
\autoref{section-serialization}.
% \snote{check that cut here is OK, just trying to save space.}
%  In brief, when a
% module $\mu$ is instantiated, serialization will bind the value
% parameters of $\mu$ to the lifted values of their instances in a
% series of declarations that are added to its own. This is specified in
% the \TirName{ModInst} rule in \autoref{figure-jmodsemantics}. Another
% important detail of the \TirName{ModInst} rule is that only type
% information in type parameters is used, and migrates into the module
% via type transformation and ordinary substititution.  

\jmodsemanticsfig

Module wiring is given a standard component composition semantics. We only allow wiring of
instantiated modules, which is consistent with nesC and simpler to implement. In a wiring
$\jwire{\tt{e}_1}{\tt{e}_2}$, the exports of $\tt{e}_2$ are wired to the imports of $\tt{e}_1$.
This is specified in the \TirName{ModWire} rule in \autoref{figure-jmodsemantics}, which relies
on the following auxiliary definition of operations for combining mappings.
% space saver - SS
%  of various
% sorts (e.g.~lists of imports and exports)
\begin{definition}[Special Mapping Operations]
  Let $m$ range over vectors with mapping interpretations, in particular~$\tpdecl$, $\vpdecl$,
  $\imports$, and $\exports$. Binary operator $m_1\maploosemerge m_2$ represents (non-exclusive)
  map merge, i.e.~$m_1 \maploosemerge m_2 = m_1 @ m_2$ with the requirement that $\identifier\in
  \dom(m_1)\cap\dom(m_2)$ implies $m_1(\identifier) = m_2(\identifier)$.
%Binary operator $\mu_1\uplus\mu_2$
%represents mutually exclusive map merge; for this operation to be
%defined it must be that $\dom(\mu_1)\cap\dom(\mu_2) = \emptyset$.
%Given $\vect{\mu} = [\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_n]$ we write
%$\maploosemerge\vect{\mu}$ to denote $\mu_1 \maploosemerge \cdots
%\maploosemerge \mu_n$, similarly $\uplus\vect{\mu}$. 
  The mapping $m / S$ is the same as $m$ except undefined on domain elements in set $S$, and the
  mapping $\restrict{m}{S}$ is the same as $m$ except undefined on elements not in ${S}$.
\end{definition}
Finally, the $\TirName{ModImage}$ rule in \autoref{figure-jmodsemantics} shows that imaging it
is an assertion requiring its arguments to be a runnable module.

% lots of space saving on example formatting SS

\begin{exmp}
\label{example-scalanesssemantics}
Given code definitions in \autoref{section-overview} and an invocation
$\tt{authSpecialize}(\tt{50},\ \tt{radioM},\ \arr{\tt{k_1,k_2}})$, where $\tt{radioM: radioT}$,
and $\tt{k_1,k_2}$ are keys, the evaluation of the expression on line \ref{l:wire}, $\tt{sendM
  \ltimes \jinst{radioM}{mesgT(adt)}}$, will evaluate to the following module:
\end{exmp}
\vspace{-3mm}
\lstset{numbers=none, numberstyle=\tiny, firstnumber=5, stepnumber=1,
  numbersep=0pt, basicstyle=\ttfamily}
\lstset{escapeinside={(*@}{@*)}}
{\small
\begin{lstlisting}
 < > ( { import handle_radio_r((*@\tt{mesgT}@*)(uint8)*); ...;
         export send(m : (*@\tt{mesgT}@*)(uint8)*) 
                { radio_x(AES_sign(m, (*@$\tt{k_1}$@*))); } }
\end{lstlisting}} 
\emph{where the elided declarations include a definition of a command
\textup{\texttt{radio\_x}} imported from \tt{radioM} also with argument type
$\tt{mesgT}\textup{\texttt{(uint8)*}}$.}


\subsection{Serialization and Lifting}
\label{section-serialization}

Serialization generates a flattened DnesT source code version of a DScalaness object in memory.
At the top level, serialization binds the value parameters of a module to the results of
flattening, aka lifting, via a sequence of declarations. Here is the precise definition.
\begin{definition}[Serialization]
\label{def-serialization}
Assume given a store $\jstore$ which is implicit in the following definitions. We define
serialization of DScalaness references as follows, along with an extension of the user defined
lifting relation to sequences of references:
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule
{}
{\varnothing \ser{\jstore} \varnothing, \varnothing}

\inferrule%[Serialize]
{\vect{\tt{l}} \ser{\bm} \vect{\decl},\vect{e}}
{\serialize(\vect{x}, \vect{\t}, \vect{\tt{l}}) = \vect{\decl} @\ {\vect{\t}\ \vect{x} = \vect{e}}}
\ \ \ \ \inferrule
{\tt{l} \ser{\jstore} \vect{d}, e \\ \ttvec{l} \ser{\jstore} \vect{d'}, \vect{e}}
{\tt{l}\vect{\tt{l}} \ser{\jstore} \vect{d} @ \vect{d'}, e\vect{e}}
\end{mathpar}
\end{definition}
Although lifting is user defined, a standard strategy is to introduce a new declared variable
for each memory reference in the lifted object, and bind the variable to the lifted referent.
Hence, lifting will typically be defined recursively. In our implementation, we have adapted a
``default'' lifting which follows this strategy, and also transforms objects by just
transforming the fields into a representative struct, and ignoring methods. We will illustrate
this with an example in \autoref{section-implementation}.
% , which also shows how base values such 
% as integers are lifted
We can formally capture the essence of this transformation with the following definitions. It is
easy to see that these definitions will satisfy the requirements of \autoref{def-lifting}.
\begin{exmp} In this example we allow lifting of any object references, and transform the object
  $o$ into a structure containing the transformed fields of $o$. Methods are disregarded by the
  transformation. Here is the specification of the type transformation:
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule {\CT(\ttt{C}) =
  \gclass{C}{\gbounds{X}{S}}{N}{\fieldvec{R}{f};\ K\ \ttvec{M}}}
          {\codt{\jinst{C}{\ttvec{T}}} = \lc \vect{\ttt{f}} :
            \codt{\ttvec{R}[\ttvec{T}/\ttvec{X}]} \rc}
\end{mathpar}
and here is the specification of lifting.
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule
{\jstore(\tt{p}) = \ttvec{l} \\ \fields{C} = \tdecls{T}{f} \\ 
 \ttvec{l} \ser{\jstore} \vect{d}, \vect{e} \\ x \ \text{ fresh}} 
{\jref{p}{\jinst{C}{\ttvec{R}}} \ser{\jstore} \vect{\decl} 
   @ (\xlet{\codt{\jinst{C}{\ttvec{R}}}}{x}{\lc \vect{\ttt{f}} = \vect{e}\rc}) , x}
\end{mathpar}
\end{exmp}


\subsection{DScalaness Type Checking}
\label{section-typing}

The primary novelty of DScalaness are the rules for DnesT module typing and composition, and
that is the focus of this section.
% boilerplate cut to save space - SS
% The DScalaness Type judgements are of the form $\Gamma \vdash \tt{e} :
% \tt{T}$, where $\Gamma$ is a free variable typing environment and
% judgement validity is obtained via a deduction system. 
We adopt the typing rules of FGJ in their entirety, and refer the reader to \cite{FJ} for
relevant details. % Since type construction via
% \tt{typedef} is syntactic sugar for normal object construction, 
% that is covered by those rules as well.


%\begin{theorem}[AFGJ Type Safety]
%If $\varnothing \vdash \tt{e} : \tt{N}$ and $\tt{e} \rightarrow^*
%\tt{e}'$ with $\tt{e}'$ irreducible\footnote{This is defined as ``normal
%form'' in \cite{XXX}.}, then $\tt{e}'$ is either a
%reference $\jref{\tt{p}}{N'}$ with $\tt{N'} <: \tt{N}$, or an
%expression containing $(\tt{N}')\tt{\jref{\tt{p}}{N''}}$ where
%$\tt{N''}\not<:\tt{N}'$.
%\end{theorem}

DScalaness syntax for expressing DnesT module types is $\jmodt{\tpdecl}{\jmodtcat}$, where
$\jmodtcat$ is a DnesT module type. The $\tpdecl$ in this form represents the type bounds of
dynamically constructed types that have been used to instantiate the module; we refer to this
part of the type as the \emph{instance coercion}. Because these types are dynamically
constructed, their identity is not known statically, hence the need to treat them as
upper-bounded type names in the static type analysis. This subtle technical point of our type
system is discussed at more length in \autoref{section-framedml}. It is important to note that
the type names in $\tpdecl$ will be fully resolved at run time, so that any module generated by
a DScalaness program execution will have a fully reified DnesT type. Throughout this paper, we
abbreviate $\jmodt{\emptyset}{\jmodtcat}$ as $\jmodtcat$ for brevity.

This is reflected in the \TirName{ModT} rule in \autoref{figure-scalanesstyping}, which connects
the DnesT typing system with the DScalaness type system. Since in this case we are typing an
uninstantiated module definition its instance coercion is empty. An instance coercion in a
module type is directly populated when a module is instantiated, as in the \TirName{ModInstT}
rule. Here, the type instances $\ttvec{e}_1$ are all dynamically constructed, so they define the
upper bounds of the instantiated module's instance coercion. We also expect all type and value
parameters to respect the typing bounds specified in the module definition.
%A subtle but significant detail in this rule is the
%consequence of dynamically constructed types having no meaning ``as
%types'' at the DScalaness level. This means that no DScalaness value of
%that type can be constructed, so dynamically constructed type names do
%not occur in the typings of value parameters. This detail is of
%practical importance, and will be discussed at greater length in
%\autoref{section-futurework}.
The \TirName{ModWireT} typing rule for module wiring is a straightforward reflection of the
operational rule for module wiring, as is the \TirName{ModImageT} rule for module runnability
imaging.
\begin{exmp}
\label{example-scalanesstyping}
Returning to the code and type examples in \autoref{section-overview}, we may assign the
following typing:
$$
  G \vdash \tt{authSpecialize}(\tt{50},\ \tt{radioM},\ \arr{\tt{k_1,k_2}}) \ : \tt{commT}\  
$$
Given $\tt{radioM : radioT, k_1 : uint8[], k_2 : uint8[]} \in G$.  
%and
%$$    
%  G \vdash \jinst{sendC}{adt} \ltimes \jinst{radioC}{adt}\ :\   
%    \jmodt{\tt{adt} \subtype \tt{int32}}{\margs{}\lc \ 
%      ;\,
%      \tt{error\_t\ send(\tt{adt\ s}, \tt{adt\ d}, \tt{data\ uint8[\,]})} \rc}
%$$
%$$
%\text{where}\ \t = \lc \tt{src : adt}; \tt{dest : adt}; \tt{data : uint8[\,]} \rc 
%$$
