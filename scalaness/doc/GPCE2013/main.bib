  ABSTRACT = {This paper reports on the development and formal certification (proof
of semantic preservation) of a compiler from Cminor (a C-like
imperative language) to PowerPC assembly code, using the Coq proof
assistant both for programming the compiler and for proving its
correctness.  Such a certified compiler is useful in the context of
formal methods applied to the certification of critical software: the
certification of the compiler guarantees that the safety properties
proved on the source code hold for the executable compiled code as well.},
