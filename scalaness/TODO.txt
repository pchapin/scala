========

+ Adjust the way wiring is done at runtime so that it follows the current (uni-directional)
  rules. Look at src/compiler/edu/vtc/uvm/ProgramComponent.scala.

+ Finish implementing the type rules. [DONE?]

+ The boilerplate that has to be added to each object or class that supports a nesT module
  should be automatically generated by the compiler. [IN PROGRESS]


**************************
* Finish SpartanRPC Sample
**************************

  + Relative paths in the Scalaness configuration file should be taken as relative to the file's
    location and not relative to the compiler's working directory.
