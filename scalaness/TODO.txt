========

+ Adjust the way wiring is done at runtime so that it follows the current (uni-directional)
  rules. Look at src/compiler/edu/vtc/uvm/ProgramComponent.scala.

+ Adjust the way the "magic" methods are identified so they are only processed when they are
  used on a suitably typed object. We want to ignore methods with the same name defined in other
  classes. This is necessary before one can do a full build cleanly.

+ Finish implementing the type rules.

+ Finish the SpartanRPC example.
