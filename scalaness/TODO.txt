========

+ Adjust the way wiring is done at runtime so that it follows the current (uni-directional)
  rules. Look at src/compiler/edu/vtc/uvm/ProgramComponent.scala.

+ Adjust the way the "magic" methods are identified so they are only processed when they are
  used on a suitably typed object. We want to ignore methods with the same name defined in other
  classes. This is necessary before one can do a full build cleanly.

+ Finish implementing the type rules.

+ The boilerplate that has to be added to each object or class that supports a nesT module
  should be automatically generated by the compiler.

+ Rename "Mininess" to "nesT" throughout. This will be a bit of a chore and it adds no new
  functionality. Low priority.


**************************
* Finish SpartanRPC Sample
**************************

  + Relative paths in the Scalaness configuration file should be taken as relative to the file's
    location and not relative to the compiler's working directory.
